#### Design Proposal
I would like to create a phone case that has the capabilty to charge a phone through solar power.  I would like to take solar cells and wire them to a case that protects the cells and the phone.  The case itself will have its own electrical storage which when desired can provide power to the phone.  The case itself can constantly be charged through the sun.  In terms of cost I am unsure how much it would take to manufacture and produce, however I believe it would be affordable enough to function both as a case and a portable charger.
